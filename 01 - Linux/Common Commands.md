**more** - is a pager utility that displays the contents of text files one screen or page at a time, making it easier to read long files in the terminal. It allows you to scroll through large files without overwhelming your screen with text all at once
## Navigation Commands

While viewing a file with `more`, you can use these keyboard shortcuts:​

- **Spacebar** - Move forward one full screen
    
- **Enter** - Move forward one line at a time
    
- **b** - Move back one screen
    
- **q** - Quit and exit the viewer
    
- **/pattern** - Search for text pattern within the file
    
- **n** - Jump to next occurrence of search pattern
    
- **h** - Display help with available commands

**ls**  list directory contents

- `ls -a`  
    Lists **all files**, including hidden ones (names starting with `.`).
    
- `ls -l`  
    Shows **long format** with permissions, owner, group, size, and modification time.
    
- `ls -la`  
    Long format plus all files (including hidden ones).
    

## Format and readability

- `ls -h`  
    Shows sizes in **human‑readable units** (KB, MB, etc.), usually with `-l` as `ls -lh`.
    
- `ls -F`  
    Appends type indicators (e.g., `/` for directories, `*` for executables).

    Lists one entry per line instead of in columns.
    

## Sorting and ordering

- `ls -t`  
    Sorts by **modification time**, newest first.
    
- `ls -r`  
    **Reverses** the sort order (e.g., `ls -tr` for oldest first).
    
- `ls -S`  
    Sorts by **file size**, largest first.
    

## Directory and recursion

- `ls -R`  
    Lists contents **recursively** (including subdirectories).
    
- `ls -d`  
    Lists **directories themselves**, not their contents (often used with patterns like `ls -d */`).
